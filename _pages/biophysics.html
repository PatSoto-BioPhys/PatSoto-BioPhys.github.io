<ul>
<li> Templated misfolding: prion protein â€“ fibril recognition. Our current focus! 
<li>Lipid membrane composition and GPI anchoring modulate prion protein - membrane surface interactions <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fbinf.2023.1321287">doi</a>.
  <ul>
  <li>Fun fact: This article was our first publication that uses a coarse-graining of a lipid membrane to observe selective prion protein - membrane binding. We compared with the Doppel protein (closest related protein to prion protein) and to our suprise the binding behavior of the two proteins was distinct.
  <li>Team of authors: Undergraduates majoring in biomedical physics and chemistry, high schoolers.
  </ul>
    
<li> Side chain connectivity pattern in the globular domain of the prion protein in mammals explains native conformational dynamics and structural role of 
  pharmacological chaperones that prevent misfolding  <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/19336896.2023.2186674">doi</a>.
  <ul>
  <li> Fun fact: This article was our first publication demonstrating the usefulness of normal mode analysis combined with network analysis and molecular docking to compare protein structures from the same family across species. A lot of this work happened during the covid pandemic, meeting with students via zoom daily, and each of us doing our best to navigate the unexpected.

<li> Residue substitutions linked to prion protein misfolding alter the local conformational dynamics of loops <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/07391102.2019.1708794">doi</a>.
  <ul>
  <li>Fun fact: This article demonstrates how all-atom MD simulations illustrate conformational preferences in a flexible loop. We learned how to interpret network analysis metrics to make sense of communication across the protein structure
