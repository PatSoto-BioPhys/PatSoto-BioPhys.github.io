My academic mission is to cultivate inclusive communities of undergraduate researchers focused on using structural bioinformatics techniques to investigate pathological protein folding in order to unravel molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative proteinopathies in humans. 

By integrating insights from the sciences of learning, I design, implement, and evaluate educational experiences that advance our understanding of how students effectively learn at the convergence of physical and life sciences. I actively participate in communities of educators, collaborating to co-create enriched educational opportunities for students. Together, we strive to foster a transformative academic environment that empowers students and contributes to scientific knowledge and discovery.
