I strive to nurture inclusive communities of undergraduate researchers that use structural bioinformatics techniques to study protein conformational dynamics and folding in order to elucidate molecular mechanisms hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases. 

I use outcomes from the sciences of learning to design, implement, and assess educational experiences for undergraduates in order to advance our understanding of how students learn at the intersection of physical and life sciences. 

I engage in communities of educators to co-create enriched educational experiences for students.
