I strive to cultivate inclusive communities of undergraduate researchers who use structural bioinformatics to investigate protein conformational dynamics and folding. Our goal is to unravel molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative proteinopathies in humans. 

I leverage insights from the sciences of learning to design, implement, and assess educational experiences that advance our understanding of student learning at the intersection of physical and life sciences. I actively engage with communities of educators to collaboratively create enriching educational opportunities for students.
