The Teacher-Centered Systemic Reform model is the theoretical basis for my classroom reform. At the physics department at Creighton University, I have piloted a studio physics classroom for life sciences students that uses physical and virtual manipulatives. The course re-design weaves three main strategies:

* Strategy 1: Use of ["powerful teaching"](https://www.powerfulteaching.org/) techniques backed up by the science of learning: retrieval, interleaving, and spaced repetition.
* Strategy 2: Use of iOLab devices during class time to catalyze the development of physics modeling and sense-making skills. The [iOLab device](http://www.iolab.science/), the size of a thick iPhone, is a robust platform full of sensors that records several physical properties. The dedicated software interface allows the user to plot recordings and do basic statistical analysis. The iOLab is a versatile, reliable, and low cognitive load tool. Physics education research indicates that physical manipulatives enhance content learning and skill development. I develop or adapt guided inquiry-based worksheets that students work on collaboratively during class time. 
* Strategy 3: Use a standards-based grading scheme.

I also lead the re-design of the second lab course in the sequence of general physics labs for life sciences students. I adjusted course content and delivery to reach out students and scaffold mastery of physics concepts students may encounter in future non-physics courses.
