I have piloted a studio physics classroom for life sciences students that uses physical and virtual manipulatives. The course re-design weaves three main strategies:

* Strategy 1: Use of ["powerful teaching"](https://www.powerfulteaching.org/) techniques backed up by the science of learning: retrieval, interleaving, and spaced repetition.
* Strategy 2: Use of physical and virtual manipulatives during class time to catalyze the development of physics modeling and sense-making skills. For physical manipulatives, I use the [iOLab device](http://www.iolab.science/), a versatile, reliable, and low cognitive load tool. For virtual manipulatives, I use primarily PhET animations. I develop or adapt guided inquiry-based worksheets that students work on collaboratively during class time. 
* Strategy 3: Use a standards-based grading scheme. The approach prompts me to think deeply about class design, individual student growth, the value of assessment, and what "learning physics" means in my students at my institution. 

I also lead the re-design of the second lab course in the sequence of general physics labs for life sciences students. I adjusted course content and delivery to reach out students and scaffold mastery of physics concepts students may encounter in future non-physics courses.
