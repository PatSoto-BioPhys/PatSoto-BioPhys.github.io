Ultimately, my teaching practice aims at scaffolding the transformation of the student into a self-directed, lifelong learner who consciously adopts the scientific method to contribute ethically to our society. The current higher education landscape prompts me to design an educational experience that responds to:

* The disciplinary expectations, needs, and challenges of the current and future workforce that demands the integration of physical and life sciences (https://visionandchange.org/).
* The (post)pandemic-derived opportunities and constraints.
* The demands of an interconnected and global world guided by the values of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) to build a just society.

[The Teacher-Centered Systemic Reform model](figure_TCSR.jpg) is the theoretical basis for my classroom reform.
