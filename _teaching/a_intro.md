Ultimately, my teaching practice aims at scaffolding the transformation of the student into a self-directed, lifelong learner who consciously adopts the scientific method to contribute ethically to our society. The current higher education landscape prompts me to design an educational experience that responds to:

* The evolving disciplinary expectations, needs, and challenges of the current and future workforce that increasingly requires the integration of physical and life sciences (https://visionandchange.org/).
* The coupling of opportunities and constraints arising from (post)pandemic effects and the pervasive influence of personal electronic devices and information technology, including social media and artifical-intelligence based tools.
* The demands of an interconnected and global world; a response I implement guided by the values of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) to foster a just society.

[The Teacher-Centered Systemic Reform model](figure_TCSR.jpg) is the theoretical basis for my classroom reform.
