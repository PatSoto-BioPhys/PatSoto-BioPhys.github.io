The course focuses on learning how to use statistical mechanics and fluid dynamics to explain the behavior of molecules and cells in the nanoscale. I use Phil Nelson's textbook (I tried a couple of times Rob Phillips et al.). The audience of the course is includes biomedical physics majors, physics majors, biological physics minors.
