I aim at students owning their physics learning, furthering their agency, and molding their disciplinary identity. The teaching modality I use focuses on an adapted version of Just In Time Teaching, interactive examples, in-class discussions, and staggered projects

Introduction to Biological Physics
======
The course focuses on learning how to use statistical mechanics and fluid dynamics to explain the behavior of molecules and cells in the nanoscale. I use Phil Nelson's textbook (I tried a couple of times Rob Phillips et al.). The audience of the course includes biomedical physics majors, physics majors, biological physics minors. 

Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics
======
The focus of the course is on classical thermal physics. I have used the textbook by Gould et al and also the texbook by Schroeder.

Computational Physics
======
In the most recent iteration, I used computational essays as end of course project to assess holistically student growth. I have used the textbook by Mark Newman and also the textbook by Landau, Paez & Bordeianu.
